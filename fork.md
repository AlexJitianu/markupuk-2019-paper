# How to create my own paper

## Overview

This projects allows you to:
- Edit the paper online using Oxygen XML Web Author
- See a preview of the generated PDF that is automatically generated each time you commit
- Download an archive with the paper and all the supporting files

## How it works

The "Deploy on Netlify" button below will do the following:

1. Create a Git repository under your GitHub account that will contain the paper template and supporting resources.
1. Set up a continuous publishing process that auto-generates the PDF whenever you commit changes to the paper XML source.
1. Create a "Dashboard" page for the project.

After that you will be able to access a "Dashboard" page that will give you access to the following functionality:

1. View the latest generated PDF preview of the paper.
2. Edit the file online using Oxygen XML Web Author.
3. Download an archive with the paper and all the supporting files.
4. Navigate to your GitHub repository that contains the paper XML source.

## Privacy

You can choose to make the created GitHub repository private.
The "Dashboard" page and the generated PDF will be available at a randomly-generated URL that can be accessed by anyone who knows it.
